I have developed a comprehensive grocery store application featuring two distinct interfaces to enhance user experience and streamline product management. All data is securely stored in a robust database, ensuring consistency and reliability.

Customer Interface: This page allows users to view detailed information about their purchases, including itemized lists and the total amount spent. It ensures customers have clear and immediate access to their purchase history and expenditure.

Product Management Interface: Designed for the store's management team, this page facilitates the upload and management of product information. It enables efficient updates to product availability and quantities, ensuring the store's inventory remains accurate and up-to-date.

By separating these functionalities and leveraging a centralized database, the application effectively caters to both customer needs and inventory management requirements, promoting a seamless and organized shopping experience.
